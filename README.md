# Reconnaissance

  In the context of cybersecurity, reconnaissance is the practice of covertly discovering and collecting information about a system. This method is often used in ethical hacking or penetration testing. 

# How Reconnaissance Works

  1.Collect initial information\
  2.Determine the network range\
  3.Identify active machines\
  4.Find access points and open ports\
  5.Fingerprint the operating system\
  6.Discover services on ports\
  7.Map the network
  
 # Types of Reconnaissance
   
   1.Active Reconnaissance:\
      -With active reconnaissance, hackers interact directly with the computer system and attempt to obtain information.
        
   2.Passive Reconnaissance:\
      -Passive reconnaissance gathers information without directly interacting with systems.
